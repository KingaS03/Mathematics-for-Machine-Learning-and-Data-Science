A bridge between the pure theoretical knowledge and practice opens up a new dimension of thinking. On one hand you will see how can you develop new mathematical intuition by putting your theoretical question into the proper practical context. On the other hand you will experience how mathematical skills support the understanding of practical solutions from machine learning.

Machine learning has become a universally applicable beloved tool in the recent years. Parallelly to that an increasing number of people are developing curiosity for it. There are available already many handy packages for machine learning. However to benefit the most of it (to be able to interpret the results and to get out the best from a model) good mathematical understanding of the background machinery can make a big difference.

The aim of this module is to remodel your mathematical knowledge by changing the focus from the abstract mathematics itself towards mathematics with a specific purpose and equipping you for a deeper dive into machine learning.

The material of this course is organised in Jupyter notebooks and the used programming language is Python.
